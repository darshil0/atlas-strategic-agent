## [3.2.7] - 2026-01-28

### 🚀 Dependency Modernization & Protocol Refinement

This release focuses on updating the entire library stack to the latest stable versions and refining the Agent Development Kit (ADK) documentation with production-ready interfaces.

### Added
- **Strongly-Typed Contracts**: The ADK (Agent Development Kit) moved away from `any` results. We introduced `AnalystResult` and `CriticResult` interfaces. Now, when the Analyst scores a plan, the Orchestrator doesn't "hope" the property is named `feasibilityScore`; the compiler *guarantees* it.
- **Identity Sync**: We unified the codebase versioning with the AI's internal system instruction. The agent now *knows* it is Atlas v3.2.7, aligning its reasoning with the latest technical constraints of the platform.
- **Enhanced Refinement Loop**: Formalized the iterative feedback mechanism in `MissionControl` to support up to 3 optimization cycles.

- **Library Modernization**: Updated 25+ dependencies to their latest versions, including React 19.2.4+, Vitest 4.0.18+, and Vite 7.3.1+.
- **Unified Versioning**: Synchronized version identifiers across 27+ files, including internal headers, logging, and AI system instructions.
- **Fixed Smoke Tests**: Resolved path alias resolution issues and updated Vitest configuration for `logHeapUsage` compatibility.

### [3.2.6] - 2026-01-28

### 🚀 Orchestration Hardening & Synchronization

This release focuses on hardening the multi-agent orchestration pipeline, fixing critical JSON parsing logic for LLM responses, and reconciling local codebase with premium remote features.

### Added
- **Dynamic Agent Metadata**: Agents now return strongly-typed results (`AnalystResult`, `CriticResult`) instead of unstructured objects.
- **Enhanced MissionControl**: Improved iterative refinement loop in `orchestrator.ts` with better feedback propagation.

### Fixed
- **JSON Parsing Logic**: Fixed critical bug in `GeminiService` where leading/trailing brackets were being stripped from structured JSON responses, causing intermittent parsing failures.
- **Multi-Agent Property Mapping**: Resolved property mismatches in the `Strategist → Analyst → Critic` pipeline that caused missing feasibility scores and review notes.
- **Git Reconciliation**: Unified local environment with remote v3.2.5 feature set, restoring glassmorphic UI assets and advanced agent swarm logic.
- **Type-Check & Linting**:
  - Fixed 50+ type errors related to `MissionResult` and `SubTask` interfaces.
  - Resolved `vitest.config.ts` version mismatch through type casting.
  - Fixed "unused-vars" and "empty-functions" lint errors across `setup.ts` and `agents.ts`.
- **UI State Management**: Fixed a type mismatch in `Sidebar.tsx` where `activeTaskId` failed strict null checks.

### [3.2.5] - 2026-01-24

### 🚀 Continuous Improvement & Infrastructure

This release focuses on centralized utilities, improved code organization, and addressing critical linting errors and broken imports discovered during integration.

### Added
- **Centralized Utilities**: Introduced `src/lib/utils.ts` with a standardized `cn` utility for Tailwind class merging.
- **Improved Project Structure**: Migrated 5+ components to use centralized utilities, reducing code duplication.

### Fixed
- **Import Resolution**: Fixed broken imports of `@types/plan.types` in `TaskBank.tsx` and `ui.tsx`.
- **Linting & Quality**:
  - Resolved "unexpected empty arrow function" error in `App.tsx`.
  - Fixed missing `motion` imports in `src/config/ui.tsx`.
  - Corrected versioning inconsistencies in the header and metadata.
- **Production Safety**: Enhanced `A2UIRenderer` event handling with logging and validation.
- **Coverage**: Increased strictness of test coverage thresholds from 80% to 85%.
- **UI Quality**:
  - Implemented noise texture overlay for premium "film-grain" aesthetic.
  - Added staggered entrance animations for welcome prompts using Framer Motion.
  - Enhanced input focus states with glows and rings.
- **Documentation**:
  - Restored readable text in "Technical Deep Dive" by fixing global find-replace errors.
  - Updated directory structure in contributing guidelines to match source.
  - Added navigation links to technical documentation in README.
- **Type Safety**:
  - Removed explicit `any` usage in `CriticAgent` by utilizing proper `Plan` type inference.
  - Eliminated unnecessary type casting in `PersistenceService` validation logic.
  - Fixed missing `Priority` import in `agents.ts`.

### Changed
- **Branding**: Updated internal versioning to `v3.2.5` across all dashboard elements.
- **Codebase**: Refactored `App.tsx` by extracting `Sidebar` component to reduce cognitive load and improve maintainability.
