All notable changes to the **Atlas Strategic Agent** will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-07

Atlas has been transformed from a task decomposition tool into a full-scale **Enterprise Strategic Agent**.

### 🚀 Added
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Collaborative synthesis engine featuring **Strategist**, **Analyst**, and **Critic** personas with automated conflict resolution loops.
- **Simulation Engine**: "What-If" failure analysis that predicts mission cascades and calculates real-time risk scores.
- **Strategic Timeline**: Advanced GANTT-style roadmap visualization for chronological mission mapping.
- **External Grounding**: Live Tool Bridge for context injection via URLs and real-world data retrieval.
- **Persistence 2.0**: Mission state recovery allowing seamless resumption of long-term strategic projects.
- **Intelligence Recall**: Memory storage for recording and recalling strategic patterns across missions.

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- **Glassmorphic Interface**: Fully overhauled design system with premium frosted-glass aesthetics.
- **Inter-View Connectivity**: Synchronized interaction between the Dependency Graph, Task Bank, and Timeline.
- **A2UI Protocol**: Native support for Agent-to-User Interface components (Selects, Charts, Interactive Inputs).

### 🛠 Technical Improvements
- **100% Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript migration with zero-any architecture.
- **Path Aliasing**: Optimized project structure with `@/*` root-level mapping.
- **Performance**: Integrated `framer-motion` for smoother layout transitions.
